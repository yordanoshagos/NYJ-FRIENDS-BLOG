        <p>If I could rename Born a Crime, I'd go with "Mama's Lionheart". Born a Crime is powerfull, but it focuses on how Trevor was born during a bad time. "Mama Lion Heart" puts the spotlight on his mother, Patricia, who was strong and brave. She protected Trevor and taught him how to survive and be strong too. Their bond was full of love and that's what helped him grow into the smart, funny, and tough person he is today. So, this title shows the story isn't just about racism and pain, but about a mother's love and strength. The word "lionheart" shows how brave she was and how Trevor got his courage from her.

    <h3 class="mama">The Cage of Abel's Expectation</h3>
    <div class="abel-quote">
        <div class="insight">
        <p>The line in the book about  Trevor's stepdad, Abel "He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage." That line says a lot. It means some people like strong woman butonly so they can control them. They on't want a real partner. They want someone thy can show off, then tell what to do. This still happens today. We tell woman to be smart, strong and speak their minds. But in some relationships, that strength makes their partners fell scared or jealous then woman feel like they have to act smaller or quieter to make others feel okay. <br>I've seen it happen. Like when a woman talks less about her job so her partner doesn't feel bad. Or when a men feels upset that his girlfriend makes more money then him even if he first said he was proud  of her. These are like invisible cages. They don't have bars but they still hold people back. <br>Abel wanted a woman who would listen and obey but he fell in love with Patricia, who was brave and bold to be in a cage. The problem wasn't her it was his idea of what love should be. Real love means letting someone be free and cheering them on as they grow. It's not about locking them in. It's about walking beside them, not in front of or behind them. </p>
